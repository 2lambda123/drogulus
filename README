Drogulus!
=========

Drogulus is an exercise in producing the simplest and smallest means of working
with federated linked data. It's also a playground for distributed computation
and an exercise in practical philosophy. It's heavily based upon ideas from
Fluidinfo.

To begin with it'll simply be a collection of documents and ideas I'll store in
GIT only because I'd like to track how they change.

It'll probably all come to nothing. ;-)

Motivation
==========

Autonomy ~ literally, "autos" (self) "nomos" (rule or law) is a favourite word
of mine.

When someone or something is autonomous it is self-directing, free to act of its
own accord and lacking imposition or direct control from external parties. It
also suggests intelligence and awareness enough to be able to enjoy and make use
of such freedom.

To my mind, it is a desirable state to be in, to aspire to and to encourage.

It's also the opposite of terms describing such undesirable states as tyranny,
slavery, ignorance and apathy.

The definition I use above is common in that it contains two different states:

# Freedom to self-determination, and
# Freedom from imposition or coercion.

Perhaps the most famous exposition of these states is made by the philosopher
Isiah Berlin in his essay "Two Concepts of Liberty" (Berlin uses the words
freedom and liberty interchangeably). He calls them positive and negative
liberty and introduces them by relating them to a question:

    "...the negative sense, is involved in the answer to the question "What is
    the area within which the subject - a person or a group of persons - is or
    should be left to do or be what he is able to do or be, without interference
    by other persons?" The second, ...the positive sense, is involved in the
    answer to the question "What, or who, is the source of control or
    interference that can determine someone to do, or be, this rather than
    that?"

Put simply, negative liberty is freedom from coercion or interference.

Berlin qualifies this by saying that coercion implies deliberate interference
from other persons when one could act otherwise and that the capacity to do or
act in a particular way does not count as a lack of ones political liberty. As
Berlin puts it, "If I say I am unable to jump more than ten feet in the air ...
it would be eccentric to say that I am to that degree enslaved or coerced. You
lack political liberty or freedom only if you are prevented from attaining the
goal by human beings."

Positive liberty is freedom to act in a particular way, the capacity for a
person or a group to take control of their lives, making decisions which depend
not on external forces but on their (or his or her) own choices and reasons.

Berlin explains, "I wish to be the instrument of my own, not of other men's
acts of will. I wish to be a subject, not an object; to be moved by reasons, by
conscious purposes, which are my own, not by causes which affect me, as it were,
from outside. I wish to be somebody, not nobody; a doer - deciding, not by
external nature or by other men as if I were a thing, or an animal, or a slave
incapable of playing a human role, that is, of conceiving goals and policies of
my own and realising them."

The two definitions are related in that they can be used to mutually frame each
other:

A person who is acting under or desiring positive liberty wants to be
self-determining, free from interference and external imposition ("deciding,
not being decided for, self directed and not acted upon by external nature or
by other men...", as Berlin puts it) whilst another acting under or desiring
negative liberty wants to make up their own mind without suffering from
coercion or imposition, as Berlin says, negative liberty, "is simply the area
within which a man can act unobstructed by others."

But are these definitions of freedom/liberty the same as autonomy?

No.

What makes autonomy different is a will to act. Freedom/liberty is a
necessary condition for autonomy but not the only condition. One might have
freedom to do "this" or "that" but, due to habit, laziness, apathy or some other
reason, may simply not do "this" or "that".

In some sense, autonomy requires reflection and then a concious decision to act
upon one's freedom as a result of such reflection.

So we get to the nub of something I believe is essential: being autonomous is
good and people should have the freedom, encouragement and means to act
autonomously.

I realise this is not an exhaustive exposition of autonomy and is wide open to
philosophical hole poking.

This is a README: an overview! As such I'm simply reporting my position. I'll
defend and probably revise it as and when needed in more appropriate
documentation.

What has this got to do with software?

I have three reasons for mentioning autonomy:

# I want to put my philosophical cards on the table to show that I've built my
outlook with care and clear movement of thought. I don't want to be labelled as
simply spewing forth a free-software / opensource dogma because I'm "one of
them" (hacker/developer types).

# I want the design and implementation of Drogulus to reflect my emphasis on
autonomy. Once again, I want to show clear philosophical reasons for certain
technical and implementation details.

# Drogulus is itself an exercise in autonomy.

What is it..?
=============

In a nutshell, Drogulus is:

* A federated and decentralised, openly writeable and easily searchable
information store.
* A distributed compution platform.

Let's examine these terms:

Being federated (the system consists of many independant but collaborating
entities) and decentralised (none of these entities is more important than any
of the others) ensures users are free from a central authority that might desire
to control their use of the system. This is a decision that reflects Berlin's
concept of negative liberty.

Being openly writeable ensures no user is barred from the system. All users are
free to contribute, change, enhance and expand the system. This reflects
Berlin's concept of positive liberty.

Being easily searchable enables users to explore the information stored via
Drogulus without having to rely on others to provide such services. This
reflects both positive and negative concepts of liberty: the freedom to search
whilst being free from a broker for such searches (the facility is built in).

Being a distributed computation platform enables users to do something useful
with the information they find via Drogulus. To be clear here, by distributed
computation I mean running programs on the shared resources that Drogulus
provides. This is a direct result of the need to act in order to exercise
autonomy.

ToDo: Tidy/tighten all the above sections up. They're full of holes and could
be put better / simpler / more succinctly. It'll do as a start / brain-dump just
to get something down in writing.

Etymology of Drogulus
=====================

I've always thought that "Drogulus" is a catchy name for a project. I first
heard of the term whilst driving through the Lake District in the early hours of
the morning during a trip on my honeymoon in 1997. BBC Radio 4 was
re-broadcasting the debate I mention below.

Here's the story of its origin:

A drogulus is an entity whose presence is unverifiable, because it has no
physical effects.

The athiest philosopher A.J. Ayer coined it as a way of ridiculing the belief
system of Jesuit philosopher Frederick Copleston.

In 1949 Ayer and Copleston took part in a radio debate about the existence of
God. The debate then went back and forth, until Ayer came up with the following
as a way of illustrating the point that Copleston's metaphysics had no content
because there was no way of testing the truth of metaphysical assertions. He
said:

    "I say, 'There's a "drogulus" over there,' and you say, 'What?' and I say,
    'drogulus' and you say 'What's a drogulus?' Well, I say, 'I can't describe
    what a drogulus is, because it's not the sort of thing you can see or
    touch, it has no physical effects of any kind, but it's a disembodied
    being.' And you say, 'Well how am I to tell if it's there or it's not
    there?' and I say, 'There's no way of telling. Everything's just the same
    if it's there or it's not there. But the fact is it's there. There's a
    drogulus there standing just behind you, spiritually behind you.' Does that
    makes sense?"

Of course, the natural answer Ayer was waiting for was "No, of course it
doesn't make sense." Therefore, the implication would be that metaphysics is
like the "drogulus" ~ a being which cannot be seen and has no perceptible
effects. If Ayer can get to that point, he can claim that any kind of belief
in the Christian God or in metaphysical principles in general is really
contrary to our logical and scientific understanding of the world.

This appealed greatly to our sense of humour and we ended up talking about the
debate for most of the rest of our journey.

Happy days..! :-)
