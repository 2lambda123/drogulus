Logos
-----

A very simple programming language for constrained distributed computing.

Small fragments of code defining functions are run on nodes in a distributed
network that contain data to be acted upon.

Constraints
===========

Logos code receives a context and returns a result.

Logos code is executed in a highly constrained sandboxed environment.
Constraints are of two types:

* memory available to the function;
* time within which execution must complete.

These are defined by the executing node on the network. The minimum viable
sandbox has 128MB of memory and 3 seconds of time.
