Welcome to the drogulus's documentation!
========================================

WABI SABI!

Today's internet means walled gardens of data, points of control, censorship and surveillance.

So I asked myself, how would software designed to promote independence, freedom and autonomy work? I tried to imagine the simplest possible solution and the drogulus was born.

The drogulus is a programmable openly writeable peer-to-peer data store. It is (potentially) a decentralised global digital infrastructure in a similar way to the Web being a global digital infrastructure of centralized services (Facebook, Google etc).

It is for anyone who wants to build, live and do business in a digital world where users remain in control.
