What is it..?
+++++++++++++

Put Simply
==========

Drogulus is a federated, decentralized, openly writable yet
easily searchable information store and distributed computation platform that
includes mechanisms for privacy, provenance and trust via public/private key
technology.

Being federated (the system consists of many independent but collaborating
entities) and decentralized (no entity is more important than any of the others)
ensures users are free from a central authority that might desire to control
their use of the system. This is a decision that reflects Berlin's concept of
negative liberty.

Being openly writable ensures no user is barred from the system. All users are
free to contribute, change, enhance and expand the system. This reflects
Berlin's concept of positive liberty.

Being a computation platform means users can explore the information stored via
Drogulus without having to rely on others to provide such services. This
reflects both positive and negative concepts of liberty: the freedom to process
information whilst being free from a broker for such computation (the facility
is built in).

Being a distributed computation platform enables users to do something useful
with the information they find via Drogulus. By distributed computation I mean
running programs on the shared resources that Drogulus provides. This
facilitates acting on information obtained via Drogulus in order to exercise
autonomy.

Having a mechanism for privacy, provenance and trust makes it possible to save
information via Drogulus without fear of having it made public, ensures you know
the source of any information obtained via Drogulus and allows you to share
your information with only those that you trust. It ensures users of Drogulus
know who each other are and retain control of their information without needing
to rely on external parties.

Etymology of Drogulus
=====================

I've always thought that "Drogulus" is a catchy name for a project. I first
heard of the term whilst driving through the Lake District in the early hours of
the morning during a trip on my honeymoon in 1997. BBC Radio 4 was
re-broadcasting the debate I mention below.

Here's the story of its origin:

A drogulus is an entity whose presence is unverifiable, because it has no
physical effects.

The atheist philosopher A.J. Ayer coined it as a way of ridiculing the belief
system of Jesuit philosopher Frederick Copleston.

In 1949 Ayer and Copleston took part in a radio debate about the existence of
God. The debate then went back and forth, until Ayer came up with the following
as a way of illustrating the point that Copleston's metaphysics had no content
because there was no way of testing the truth of metaphysical assertions. He
said:

    "I say, 'There's a "drogulus" over there,' and you say, 'What?' and I say,
    'drogulus' and you say 'What's a drogulus?' Well, I say, 'I can't describe
    what a drogulus is, because it's not the sort of thing you can see or
    touch, it has no physical effects of any kind, but it's a disembodied
    being.' And you say, 'Well how am I to tell if it's there or it's not
    there?' and I say, 'There's no way of telling. Everything's just the same
    if it's there or it's not there. But the fact is it's there. There's a
    drogulus there standing just behind you, spiritually behind you.' Does that
    makes sense?"

Of course, the natural answer Ayer was waiting for was "No, of course it
doesn't make sense." Therefore, the implication would be that metaphysics is
like the "drogulus" ~ a being which cannot be seen and has no perceptible
effects. If Ayer can get to that point, he can claim that any kind of belief
in the Christian God or in metaphysical principles in general is really
contrary to our logical and scientific understanding of the world.

This appealed greatly to our sense of humour and we ended up talking about the
debate for most of the rest of our journey.

Happy days..! :-)
