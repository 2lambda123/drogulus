Drogulus Documentation
======================

Documentation for Drogulus is built using the sphinx project (see:
http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ for more information). To install sphinx simply use
pip::

    $ pip install sphinx

To build the documentation, make sure you're in this directory and run the
following command::

    $ make html

The resulting HTML can be found in the `_build/html` directory.

PDF copies of academic papers used / referenced within the Drogulus project
can be found in the `papers` directory.
