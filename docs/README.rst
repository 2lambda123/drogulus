Drogulus Documentation
======================

Documentation for Drogulus is built using the sphinx project (see:
http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ for more information). To install sphinx simply use
pip::

    $ pip install sphinx

To build the documentation, make sure you're in this directory and run the
following command::

    $ make html

Alternatively, from the root directory of this project (one level up from this
one) run the following command::

    $ make docs

The resulting HTML can be found in the ``_build/html`` directory.

PDF copies of academic papers used / referenced within the Drogulus project
can be found in the ``papers`` directory.
