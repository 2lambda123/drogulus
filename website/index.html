            <div id="what">
                <h3>What</h3>
                <p>Drogulus is a federated, decentralized and openly writable
                data store and computation platform that includes mechanisms
                for provenance and trust via public key cryptography.</p>

                <p>Being federated (the system consists of many independent
                but collaborating entities) and decentralized (no entity is
                more important than any of the others) ensures users are free
                from points of authority that may be used to control user's
                access to data and use of the system.</p>

                <p>Being openly writable ensures no user is barred from the
                system. All users are free to contribute, change, enhance and
                expand the system.</p>

                <p>Being a distributed computation platform means users can do
                something useful with the information they find via Drogulus.
                By distributed computation I mean running programs on the
                shared resources that Drogulus provides without having to rely
                on others to provide such services.</p>

                <p>Having a mechanism for provenance and trust allows users of
                Drogulus to know who each other are and retain control of
                their data without needing to rely on external parties.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="why">
                <h3>Why</h3>

<p>The World-Wide Web has become a ghetto of walled gardens built upon years of
technological compromise. DNS (used to link domain names with their host
computer) is beholden to the whims of governments and companies without
recourse to due process. More worryingly still, our data is analyzed by
companies, sold via targeted advertising or handed over to governments without
our consent.</p>

<p><strong>Problem #1: Users are no longer in control of their digital
assets or identity.</strong></p>

<p>In order to publish anything on the web most users need third party services
(web sites) to curate data on their behalf. How this data is organized is
usually decided by the service provider rather than the user whose data it is.
Furthermore, how this data is stored and made available is often done in such a
way that makes it difficult to change service provider. As if that wasn't
enough, each service requires its own set of credentials to identify the user -
making it hard to tell if the provenance of data on one service is the same as
that on yet another. Baroque technological solutions have been proposed to
solve the problem of multiple identities on different services but these are
merely a manifestation of problem #2 (see below).</p>

<p><strong>Problem #2: hackers (used in the positive sense of the word) are
obstructed by incumbent technology from tackling problems with elegant,
useful and joyful solutions.</strong></p>

<p>The beautifuly simple hypertext system originally envisioned by
Tim Berners-Lee has grown into a monster. It's a plethora of complex
technologies specified by committee that run on quirky browsers which never
behave consistently. The ubiquity of the web also means it has assumed the
status of de-facto platform for solutions thoughtlessly implemented in a
sub-optimal way in order to cope with the limitations of web based technology.
Furthermore, the resilience of the web's decentralized nature has been
undermined: large parts of the web go dark when certain hosting providers
break down or if popular websites fall over. This is the inevitable result of
developer's reliance on such services.</p>

<p><strong>Problem #3: At a fundamental level the web isn't openly writable or
configurable.</strong></p>

<p>Creating, editing or organising content is not part of the web itself, but
implemented at a higher level of abstraction (causing problem #1) in a way that
abuses and complicates the original simple hypertext system (see problem #2).
This technical situation has profound political and ethical implications
concerning control, privacy and participation. Such potential disempowerment
even extends to DNS - the mechanism for linking domains to the computers
that host websites.</p>

<p>Ultimately the web is no longer a flat structure of interlinking documents
but now contains many points of control, lock-in and authority each of which
is a potential mechanism for disempowerment and exploitation.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="how">
                <h3>How</h3>
                <p>There are three central pillars to Drogulus:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A distributed hash table (DHT) that provides the data
                    store and replaces DNS.</li>
                    <li>Trust and identity enforced via cryptographic
                    signing of digital assets.</li>
                    <li>Drogulisp, a simple implementation of the Lisp
                    programming language for asynchronously working with data
                    stored in the DHT.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Drogulus implements a version of the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia">Kademlia</a>
                distributed hash table. The innovation Drogulus brings to the
                table is that values (data) stored in the DHT are
                cryptographically signed in such a way that their provenance
                can be proven and content shown to be "intact" (i.e. not
                tampered with). Values that do not pass the cryptographic
                checks are ignored and nodes on the network that attempt to
                propogate such values are blocked. Drogulisp programs are
                themselves values stored within the DHT, run in asynchronous
                "ensembles" that arrive at a consensus and process other items
                of data (including other programs) stored within the DHT. They
                are intentionally limited in terms of time (how long a
                computation may last) and space (how much memory may be
                used).</p>

                <p>Currently, the DHT is almost finished, the cryptographic
                layer is done and Drogulisp is in the planning stages.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="install">
                <h3>Install</h3>
                <p>Drogulus is written in
                <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> and you should ensure
                that a recent version (such as 2.7) is installed on your
                machine.</p>

                <p>There are several ways to install Drogulus. Using Python's
                <code>pip</code> command is perhaps the easiest:</p>

                <pre><code>$ pip install -U drogulus</pre></code>

                <p>Alternatively, clone/download the source code, change into
                the project's root directory and run the following
                command:</p>

                <pre><code>$ python setup.py install</code></pre>

                <p>You may need to install the requirements with the
                following command:</p>

                <pre><code>$ pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>

                <p>The installation procedure should have installed a command
                called <code>drogd</code> on your computer. Running this
                command for the first time will walk you through setting up
                your instance of Drogulus. <span class="warning">TODO: Write
