             <h2>Why?</h2>

             <p>I have a growing unease with the current state of the web.</p>

             <p><strong>On the web, users are no longer in control of their
             data or online identity.</strong></p>

             <p>They're locked in to websites that act as walled gardens of data
             each of which requires different credentials in order to log in.
             Once logged in there is often no way to extract data. Furthermore,
             how can we tell who's who? Is <em>user X</em> on Twitter the same
             as <em>user X</em> on Facebook?</p>

             <p><strong>Programmers have to use complicated and quirky
             technology to make the web work.</strong></p>

             <p>The web is defined in a top down manner by committee, but
             watch any web developer grimace if you mention OAuth, CORS,
             Javascript date objects or (dare I say it) Internet Explorer.</p>

             <p><strong>There are many inadvertent points of control, lock-in
             and authority built in to the web.</strong></p>

             <p>Each point of control is a potential mechanism for
             dis-empowerment and exploitation. Just look at the great firewall
             of China, the censorship of the Piratebay or the kerfuffle over
             payment to Wikileaks.</p>

             <p>The beautifully simple, open and decentralised hypertext system
             envisioned by Tim Berners-Lee has grown in to a closed,
             centralised and complicated monster beholden to dodgy commercial,
             political and legal manipulation. More worryingly still, our data
             is analyzed by companies, sold via targeted advertising or handed
             over to governments without our consent.</p>

             <p>Unfortunately, many aspects of today's web are contrary to a
             concept that is very important to me: autonomy. So, I asked
             myself, how would software designed to promote autonomy function?
             I started to write code and the drogulus was born.</p>
