             <h2>Why?</h2>

             <p>The World-Wide Web has become a ghetto of walled gardens
             built upon years of technological compromise. DNS (used to
             link domain names with their host computer) is beholden to the
             whims of governments and companies without recourse to due
             process. More worryingly still, our data is analyzed by
             companies, sold via targeted advertising or handed over to
             governments without our consent.</p>

             <p><strong>Problem #1: Users are no longer in control of their
             digital assets or identity.</strong></p>

             <p>In order to publish anything on the web most users need
             third party services (web sites) to curate data on their
             behalf. How this data is organized is usually decided by the
             service provider rather than the user whose data it is.
             Furthermore, how this data is stored and made available is
             often done in such a way that makes it difficult to change
             service provider. As if that wasn't enough, each service
             requires its own set of credentials to identify the user -
             making it hard to tell if the provenance of data on one
             service is the same as that on yet another. Baroque
             technological solutions have been proposed to solve the
             problem of multiple identities on different services but these
             are merely a manifestation of problem #2 (see below).</p>

             <p><strong>Problem #2: hackers (used in the positive sense of
             the word) are obstructed by incumbent technology from tackling
             problems with elegant, useful and joyful solutions.</strong></p>

             <p>The beautifully simple hypertext system originally
             envisioned by Tim Berners-Lee has grown into a monster. It's a
             plethora of complex technologies specified by committee that
             run on quirky browsers which never behave consistently. The
             ubiquity of the web also means it has assumed the status of
             de-facto platform for solutions thoughtlessly implemented in a
             sub-optimal way in order to cope with the limitations of web
             based technology. Furthermore, the resilience of the web's
             decentralized nature has been undermined: large parts of the
             web go dark when certain hosting providers break down or if
             popular websites fall over. This is the inevitable result of
             developer's reliance on such services.</p>

             <p><strong>Problem #3: At a fundamental level the web isn't
             openly writable or configurable.</strong></p>

             <p>Creating, editing or organizing content is not part of the
             web itself, but implemented at a higher level of abstraction
             (causing problem #1) in a way that abuses and complicates the
             original simple hypertext system (see problem #2). This
             technical situation has profound political and ethical
             implications concerning control, privacy and participation.
             Such potential dis-empowerment even extends to DNS - the
             mechanism for linking domains to the computers that host
             websites.</p>

             <p>Ultimately the web is no longer a flat structure of
             interlinking documents but now contains many points of control,
             lock-in and authority each of which is a potential mechanism
             for dis-empowerment and exploitation.</p>
