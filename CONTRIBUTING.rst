I (Nicholas H.Tollervey) would like to keep the copyright status of this
project as simple as possible. To this end, any contribution to the source code
(including documentation) will be subject to the following conditions:

* The contribution was created by the contributor who confirms they have the
  right to submit it under the GNU Affero Public License version 3.

* The contribution is either completely original or based upon previous work
  that is also covered by a compatible license.

* Since all development of Drogulus is done in public, the contribution will
  be made public.

* There is no guarantee that a contribution will be accepted in to the source
  code.

Follow these steps to contribute code:

* Ensure your contribution is linked to an outstanding ticket in the issue
  tracker.

* Create a new branch for your contribution with a descriptive name and
  reference to the issue number. For example: add-blue-widget-867536

* Create the pull request from your *new* branch to the remote (i.e. my)
  master branch.

* Alternatively, send me a patch file (see git patch) via email with a
  description of the work done. ;-)

* Make sure you include tests!

* Did I mention you should include tests..? Yeah, include tests.

* If you've not done so already, add yourself to the AUTHORS file.
