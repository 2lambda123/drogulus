Drogulus!
=========

**NB: This is an unfinished work in progress.**

Drogulus is a federated data store and computation platform designed for
simplicity, security, openness and resilience. It's also an exercise in
practical philosophy.

It's heavily based upon ideas from Fluidinfo (an openly writable data store),
Kademlia (a distributed hash table), Lisp, public/private key cryptography with
a dash of Xanadu thrown in for inspiration. It is implemented in Python and
requires very few external dependencies.

It'll probably all come to nothing. ;-)

Current status: the distributed hash table is almost finished. Crypto based
work is in advanced stages of planning. Lisp implementation is an (uncommitted)
toy which requires further work.
