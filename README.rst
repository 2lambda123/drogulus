The Drogulus
============

**This is an unfinished work in progress and does not work yet!**

A small and simple peer-to-peer data store and an exercise in practical
philosophy.

It'll probably all come to nothing. ;-)

There's not a lot here right now.

Developer Setup
+++++++++++++++

This project requires Python version 3.3 (or higher).

Make a new virtualenv (see:
http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)::

    $ mkvirtualenv drogulus

Install the requirements::

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

The ``make`` command is a useful starting point. If you type ``make check``
and see a passing test suite followed by a coverage report then you should be
set up all fine and dandy.
