Drogulus
========

**NB: This is an unfinished work in progress and does not yet work.**

Check out the project's website for more details: http://drogul.us

Drogulus is a resilient federated data store and computation platform designed
for simplicity, security, openness and fun. It's also an exercise in
practical philosophy.

It's influenced by ideas from Fluidinfo (an openly writable data store),
Kademlia (a distributed hash table), Lisp, public/private key cryptography with
a dash of Xanadu thrown in for inspiration. It is implemented in Python and
requires very few external dependencies.

It'll probably all come to nothing. ;-)

Current status: the distributed hash table is almost finished. Crypto based
work is done. Lisp implementation is an (uncommitted) toy which requires
further work.

If in doubt, please ask. :-)
